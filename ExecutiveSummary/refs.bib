   abstract = {Although it has been over 15 years since the first recorded use of a robot for a surgical procedure, the field of medical robotics is still an emerging one that has not yet reached a critical mass. Although robots have the potential to improve the precision and capabilities of physicians, the number of robots in clinical use is still very small. In this review article, we begin with a short historical review of medical robotics, followed by an overview of clinical applications where robots have been applied. The clinical applications are then discussed; they include neurosurgery, ortho-pedics, urology, madlofacial surgery, radiosurgery, ophthalmology, and cardiac surgery. We conclude with a listing of technology challenges and research areas, including system architecture, software design, mechanical design, imaging compatible systems, user interface, and safety issues.

@article{Hoeckelmann2015,
   abstract = {Commercial surgical robots have been in clinical use since the mid-1990s, supporting surgeons in various tasks. In the past decades, many systems emerged as research platforms, and a few entered the global market. This paper summarizes the currently available surgical systems and research directions in the broader field of surgical robotics. The widely deployed teleoperated manipulators aim to enhance human cognitive and physical skills and provide smart tools for surgeons, while image-guided robotics focus on surpassing human limitations by introducing automated targeting and treatment delivery methods. Both concepts are discussed based on prototypes and commercial systems. Through concrete examples the possible future development paths of surgical robots are illustrated. While research efforts are taking different approaches to improve the capacity of such systems, the aim of this survey is to assess their maturity from the commercialization point of view.},
