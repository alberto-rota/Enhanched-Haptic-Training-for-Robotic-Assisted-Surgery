   abstract = {Haptically enabled hands-on or tele-operated surgical robotic systems provide a unique opportunity to integrate pre- and intra-operative information into physical actions through active constraints (also known as virtual fixtures). In many surgical procedures, including cardiac interventions, where physiological motion complicates tissue manipulation, dynamic active constraints can improve the performance of the intervention in terms of safety and accuracy. The non-energy-storing class of dynamic guidance constraints attempt to assist the clinician in following a reference path, while guaranteeing that the control system will not generate undesired motion due to stored potential energy. An important aspect that has not received much attention from the researchers is that while these methods help increase the performance, they should by no means distract the user systematically. In this paper, a viscosity-based dynamic guidance constraint is introduced that continuously redirects the tool's motion towards the reference path. The proportionality and continuity of generated forces make the method less distracting and subjectively appealing. The performance is validated and compared with two existing non-energy-storing methods through extensive experimentation.},

@article{Bettini2004,
   abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a vision-based system for cooperative manipulation at millimeter to micrometer scales. The system is based on an admittance control algorithm that implements a broad class of guidance modes called virtual fixtures. A virtual fixture, like a real fixture, limits the motion of a tool to a prescribed class or range of motions. We describe how both hard (unyielding) and soft (yielding) virtual fixtures can be implemented in this control framework. We then detail the construction of virtual fixtures for point positioning and curve following as well as extensions of these to tubes, cones, and sequences thereof. We also describe an implemented system using the JHU Steady Hand Robot. The system uses computer vision as a sensor for providing a reference trajectory, and the virtual fixture control algorithm then provides haptic feedback to implemented direct, shared manipulation. We provide extensive experimental results detailing both system performance and the effects of virtual fixtures on human speed and accuracy. Â© 2004 IEEE.},
