\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Equipment}
This reaserch has been conducted on a first-generation \davinci surgical system decommissioned in 2016 and equipped with the \textit{dVRK} (\davinci Research Kit) framework. The \textit{dVRK} \cite{Kazanzides2014} is an open-source mechatronics  system,  consisting  of  electronics,  firmware, and  software, that  is  being  used  to  controlr esearch systems based on the first-generation \davinci systems. Based on a ROS \cite{Quigley2009} framework, the \textit{dVRK} implements a high-level accessibility to the sensors, actuators and control algorithms of the \davinci robot, making it more easily interfaceable with advanced strategies and algorithms developed in the most diverse software environments.

The simulated environment developed for this project renders necessary only the surgion console, as the ROS messages are sent solely to the virtual surgical scene and not to the physical robot.
