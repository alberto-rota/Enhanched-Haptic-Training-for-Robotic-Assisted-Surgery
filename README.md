# Active Constraints in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery
This project consists in the development of a surgical training simulator integrated with the daVinci surgical system, employing Active Constraints/Virtual Fixtures that provide a haptic force feedback during the surgical task under the assistance-as-needed paradigm.

The project, conducted in the Medical Robotics section of [NearLab](https://nearlab.polimi.it/), is Alberto's MSc thesis concluding the MSc in Biomedical Engineering at _Politecnico di Milano_.

_NOTE_: This repo currently only acts as a dev backup and a version control system for relevant files. **Downloading this repo will not download the simulator**, as larger files (blend, obj, packages, bin, ...) aren't stored here and will only be shared from an external cloud storeg once the projecet is complete
***

## The Setup
A Unity-based virtual training simulator teleoperated from the MTMs of the surgeon-side cart of a dVRK.
